$Watching youTube makes me feel alive. I love to escape reality and jump into the world of others. Although reality is harsh, watching youTube gives me hope that it doesn't necessarily have to be that way. $$
$Talking to friends is always fun. Although we don't alk too often, when we talk, we talk for a long time. Eventually, I will look back at these times and rely on them for hope when I am in a desperate and dire situation.$$
$I feel suffocated living in a container box and walking otuside gives me a different peace of mind. Breathing in air and seeing people instills a sense of livelihood in me. $$
