    <p1 class = "paragraph"> <br><br>We are a Seattle based crew trying to spread positivity during these testing times. We understand that COVID-19 has impacted both our mental and physical state immensely and we want to alleviate people's mental condition by giving them the opportunity to journal their thoughts and share them. Not only can they reflect on the ups and downs life presents us with, they can also read others' stories for inspiration and positivity. Therefore, as we say, One World - One Journal.
