$I feel dissapointed in myself for wasting the valuable time I was given. I am dropping the ball way to often and it is not a satisfactory feeling. I am unable to achieve my goals and I am extremely pained. $$
$I feel extremely depressed. I feel like I am alone and although I have high ambitions, I have a void in my soul that I cannot fill without having trustworthy people around. I feel stuck and trapped. $$
$I feel proud to have accomplished everything I did in the last year. It was extremely touhg, given the pandemic, yet I did so well. I wish to continue this well and continue being proud of myself.$$
