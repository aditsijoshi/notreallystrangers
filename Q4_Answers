$I value friendships in life. They are links that can be your entire support system. Without solid friendships, it is very difficult to go far.$$
$I value money. I feel like money is a means to many ends. It can fix a lot of problems when used properly. It can make a massive impact on both the individual and the society. Furthermore,financial freedom is underrated. As they say, "It is far more comfortable to cry in the back seat of a Mercedes than it is to cry on a bicyle"$$
