What is something fun that you did today?
</h2>
<div class = "box2">

<h4>
 Today, I spent time with family. I made my parents breakfast and we ate together. Then, we went out to the outlet store to buy new clothes. There, we ate takoyaki. We then proceeded to spend a lot of money on clothes and had some really incteresting converstations while we were add it. Although our pockets weren't as deep by the end of the trip, the memories we made were.

 Today, I went on a new adventure with my friends. We had the ambition to climb Mount Si but after a rather heavy lunch, out ambitons died down to Little Si. I fell down multiple times but each wound represented a memory that I will cherish forever.

  Today, I bought a new car. I always wanted to drive a car because walking is painful but never really had the money todo so. However, today, I purchased a new car and I am overjoyed. Maybe a few days later, I will look at my bank account and start questioning myself but not today. I will drive my new whip in style :)

  Watching youTube makes me feel alive. I love to escape reality and jump into the world of others. Although reality is harsh, watching youTube gives me hope that it doesn't necessarily have to be that way.

 Talking to friends is always fun. Although we don't alk too often, when we talk, we talk for a long time. Eventually, I will look back at these times and rely on them for hope when I am in a desperate and dire situation.
