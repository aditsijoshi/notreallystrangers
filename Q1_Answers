$Today, I spent time with family. I made my parents breakfast and we ate together. Then, we went out to the outlet store to buy new clothes. There, we ate takoyaki. We then proceeded to spend a lot of money on clothes and had some really incteresting converstations while we were add it. Although our pockets weren't as deep by the end of the trip, the memories we made were. $$
$Today, I went on a new adventure with my friends. We had the ambition to climb Mount Psi but after a rather heavy lunch, out ambitons died down to Little Psi. I fell down multiple times but each wound represented a memory that I will cherish forever. $$
$Today, I bought a new car. I always wanted to drive a car because walking is painful but never really had the money todo so. However, today, I purcahsed a new car and I am overjoyed. Maybe a few days later, I will look at my bank account and start questioning myself but not today. I will drive my new whip in style :)$$
